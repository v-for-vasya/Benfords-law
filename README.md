# Benfords-law
Scans and compares a public financial statement with Benford's distribution. Type in a stock ticker followed by the type of financial statement
you would like to look at (cf=cash flow, bs=balance sheet, is=income statement) and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will compare
how the digits in the financial statement differ from Benford's distribution.
